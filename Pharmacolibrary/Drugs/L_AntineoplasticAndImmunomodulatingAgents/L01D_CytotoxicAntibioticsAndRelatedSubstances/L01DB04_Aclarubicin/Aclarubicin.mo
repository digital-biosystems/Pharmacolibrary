    </table><p>Aclarubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic that was previously used as a chemotherapy agent mainly for the treatment of acute leukemia and some solid tumors. Its use has become limited or obsolete in many countries, and it is generally not used as a first-line therapy today due to the availability of better tolerated and more effective alternatives.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for adult patients based on published sources about aclarubicin after intravenous administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
