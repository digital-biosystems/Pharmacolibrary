    </table><p>Denileukin diftitox is a recombinant fusion protein composed of interleukin-2 and diphtheria toxin fragments. It binds to the high-affinity interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor, resulting in selective cytotoxicity against malignant cells expressing this receptor. It was previously approved for the treatment of persistent or recurrent cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), but its use has been discontinued and is not currently approved or marketed.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for adults (both sexes) with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, as peer-reviewed sources don't provide explicit compartmental PK model parameters.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
