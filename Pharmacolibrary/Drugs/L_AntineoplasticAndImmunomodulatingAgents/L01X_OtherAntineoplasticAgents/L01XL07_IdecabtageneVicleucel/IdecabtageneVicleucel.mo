    </table><p>Idecabtagene vicleucel is a B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed genetically modified autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy used for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after four or more prior lines of therapy. It is currently FDA and EMA approved.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>As a CAR T-cell therapy, idecabtagene vicleucel does not have traditional pharmacokinetic parameters (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination) associated with small molecule or typical biologic drugs. Instead, expansion and persistence of transduced CAR T-cells are measured in peripheral blood. Published sources do not provide classic PK parameters such as volume of distribution or clearance.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
