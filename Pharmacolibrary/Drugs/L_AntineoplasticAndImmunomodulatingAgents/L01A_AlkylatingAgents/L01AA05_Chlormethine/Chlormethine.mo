    </table><p>Chlormethine (also known as mechlorethamine or nitrogen mustard) is an alkylating agent primarily used in the treatment of cancers such as Hodgkin lymphoma and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. It is considered a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent. While systemic use has declined due to toxicity concerns and advent of newer agents, it remains approved and used today (notably as a topical formulation) for certain lymphomas.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for intravenous administration in adult cancer patients based on classical nitrogen mustard literature, as no original detailed clinical PK publications are directly available for chlormethine (mechlorethamine).</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
