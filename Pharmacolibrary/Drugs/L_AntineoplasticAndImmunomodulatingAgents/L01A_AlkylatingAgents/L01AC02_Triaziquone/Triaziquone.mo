    </table><p>Triaziquone is an alkylating agent and a polyfunctional aziridine derivative. It was formerly investigated as an antineoplastic (anticancer) agent primarily for the treatment of various malignancies, including leukemia, lymphomas, and solid tumors. Its use is now largely obsolete, and it is not an approved or commonly used anticancer agent today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published human pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for triaziquone could be identified in the scientific literature for any population, sex, or age group.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
