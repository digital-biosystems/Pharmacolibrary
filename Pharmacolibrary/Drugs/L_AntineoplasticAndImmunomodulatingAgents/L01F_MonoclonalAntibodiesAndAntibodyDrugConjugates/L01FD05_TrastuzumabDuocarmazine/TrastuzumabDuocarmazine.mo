    </table><p>Trastuzumab duocarmazine is an antibody-drug conjugate consisting of trastuzumab, a HER2-targeted monoclonal antibody, linked to the cytotoxic agent duocarmazine (a DNA-alkylating agent). It is developed for the treatment of HER2-positive cancers, including metastatic breast cancer, and is approved in some regions under the trade name 'Enhertu'. Its mechanism involves delivering the cytotoxic compound selectively to HER2-expressing tumor cells.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic estimates are based on available limited data from public clinical trials and regulatory assessment reports in adults with advanced HER2-positive solid tumors, including breast cancer. No peer-reviewed publication offers full compartmental PK parameter disclosure.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
