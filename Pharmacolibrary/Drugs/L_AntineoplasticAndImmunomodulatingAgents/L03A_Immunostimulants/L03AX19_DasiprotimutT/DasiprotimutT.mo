    </table><p>Dasiprotimut-T is a therapeutic cancer vaccine consisting of a pool of seven synthetic peptides derived from tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and mixed with Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) as an adjuvant. It has been primarily investigated for use in melanoma as an immunotherapeutic agent. It is not approved for general clinical use at this time and remains in clinical trial investigations.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters have been reported in the literature for dasiprotimut-T in any specific population or setting, as is typical for vaccine-based immunotherapies composed of peptides and adjuvants.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
