    </table><p>Cepeginterferon alfa-2b is a long-acting, pegylated recombinant interferon alfa-2b designed to improve pharmacokinetic properties such as half-life and reduced dosing frequency compared to conventional interferon-alpha. The drug is primarily aimed for use in chronic hepatitis (such as hepatitis B or C), with potential for use in myeloproliferative neoplasms. As of 2024, cepeginterferon alfa-2b is not widely approved or marketed globally, though related pegylated forms are approved for some indications.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic models or parameter values could be identified in the peer-reviewed literature for cepeginterferon alfa-2b as of June 2024. Thus, PK parameters are not directly referenced or reported here.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
