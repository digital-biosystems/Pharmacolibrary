    </table><p>Poly ICLC (polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid stabilized with poly-L-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose) is a synthetic double-stranded RNA used as an immune modulator and adjuvant, primarily for research and investigational purposes in oncology and infectious diseases to stimulate innate immune responses via toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). It is not approved for routine clinical use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic parameters have been reported in published literature for poly ICLC in humans.
