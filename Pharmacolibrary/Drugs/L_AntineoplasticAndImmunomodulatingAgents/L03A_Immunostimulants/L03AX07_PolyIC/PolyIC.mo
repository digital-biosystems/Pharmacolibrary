    </table><p>Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) is a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA, recognized as a mimic of viral genetic material. It activates the immune system primarily via Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), stimulating interferon production and modulating immune responses. Poly I:C has been used experimentally as an immunostimulant in cancer therapy and as a research tool to model viral infection. It is not approved as a marketed drug in clinical use currently.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No human pharmacokinetic studies are available for poly I:C; the following estimates are based on preclinical literature and structural similarity to other large RNA molecules. Poly I:C is typically administered by intravenous or intraperitoneal injection.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
