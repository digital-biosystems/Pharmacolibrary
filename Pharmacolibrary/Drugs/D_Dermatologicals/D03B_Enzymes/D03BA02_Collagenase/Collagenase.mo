    </table><p>Collagenase is a proteolytic enzyme used to break down collagen, primarily used in the medical treatment for diseases involving excessive collagen accumulation including Dupuytren's contracture and Peyronie's disease. The drug is administered as a prescription medicine in certain local settings and is available under the trade name Xiaflex. Collagenase is not administered systemically and is not generally absorbed into the systemic circulation.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published systemic pharmacokinetic studies of collagenase exists, as it is administered via local injection with minimal systemic absorption. Therefore, no population pharmacokinetics can be reported.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
