    </table><p>Becaplermin is a recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB) indicated for the treatment of lower extremity diabetic neuropathic ulcers that extend into the subcutaneous tissue or beyond and have adequate blood supply. It is formulated as a topical gel and is approved for clinical use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic human study data are available for becaplermin. As a topical agent, systemic absorption is expected to be minimal. Published literature and regulatory documents indicate negligible systemic exposure after dermal application, with most of the drug remaining localized at the site of application.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
