    </table><p>Trolamine (triethanolamine) is an organic compound used primarily as a topical agent for minor skin irritations, burns, and abrasions. It is found in several over-the-counter topical products and has local anesthetic and anti-inflammatory properties. Trolamine is not approved as a systemic medication and is primarily used in topical creams for wound care and relief of minor burn pain.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies on systemic absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of trolamine in humans are available. The following estimates are based on physicochemical properties and general absorption potential of topical tertiary amines.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
