    </table><p>Aminoacridine (known also as proflavine or 3,6-diaminoacridine) is an acridine derivative that was historically used as an antiseptic for the treatment of wounds and for topical infection control. It is primarily a topical antiseptic with bacteriostatic effects. Aminoacridine is largely obsolete today and is not widely approved for systemic therapeutic use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No modern human pharmacokinetic studies are available for aminoacridine. No published data in peer-reviewed literature were identified reporting quantitative pharmacokinetic parameters (bioavailability, clearance, compartmental models, etc.) for systemic administration of aminoacridine in humans.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
