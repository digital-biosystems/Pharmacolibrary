    </table><p>Cetrimide is a quaternary ammonium antiseptic compound used as a disinfectant and topical antiseptic for cleaning wounds and burns. It has been historically used in clinical and veterinary practice mainly for its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, but is not common as a systemic medication, nor is it widely used as an approved pharmaceutical drug today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No clinical pharmacokinetic studies are available for systemic use of cetrimide in humans. Cetrimide is primarily used topically, where systemic absorption is expected to be minimal.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
