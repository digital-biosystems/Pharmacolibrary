    </table><p>Polihexanide (polyhexamethylene biguanide, PHMB) is a polymeric biguanide antiseptic and disinfectant used for wound care, contact lens disinfection, and as a preservative. It is primarily active against bacteria and some fungi and is valued for its good tissue tolerability. It is not systemically approved for internal administration and is mainly used topically.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies in humans are available. Systemic absorption is considered negligible after topical application. Parameters below are estimates only.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
