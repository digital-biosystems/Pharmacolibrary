    </table><p>Mercuric amidochloride, also known as mercuric chloride ammonia (NH2HgCl, formerly 'ammoniated mercury'), is an inorganic mercury compound historically used as a topical antiseptic and disinfectant in dermatology. Its use has largely been discontinued due to significant toxicity and potential for mercury poisoning; it is not approved for modern clinical use due to safety concerns.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No formal pharmacokinetic studies in humans are available for mercuric amidochloride. Estimates are based on general mercury compound absorption and distribution patterns. Data are not specific to gender, age, or condition.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
