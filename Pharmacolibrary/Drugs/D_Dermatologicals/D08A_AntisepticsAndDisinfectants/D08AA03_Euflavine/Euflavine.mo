    </table><p>Euflavine, also known as ethacridine lactate, is an acridine derivative with antiseptic properties. It has historically been used for topical disinfection, treatment of wounds, and as a urinary antiseptic. Its use has largely fallen out of favor with the advent of modern antibiotics and is rarely used today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies or parameter reports for euflavine in humans or animals could be identified in scientific literature.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
