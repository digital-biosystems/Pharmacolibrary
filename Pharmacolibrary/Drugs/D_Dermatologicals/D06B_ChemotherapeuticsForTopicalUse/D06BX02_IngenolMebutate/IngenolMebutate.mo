    </table><p>Ingenol mebutate is a diterpene ester derived from the plant Euphorbia peplus. It is used topically for the treatment of actinic keratosis, a precancerous skin lesion caused by sun exposure. Due to safety concerns, it has been withdrawn in some regions (e.g., EU) from the market. It is not widely used today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No conventional systemic pharmacokinetic parameters are available as per published literature, since ingenol mebutate is used topically and exhibits minimal systemic absorption in healthy adult subjects with actinic keratosis.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
