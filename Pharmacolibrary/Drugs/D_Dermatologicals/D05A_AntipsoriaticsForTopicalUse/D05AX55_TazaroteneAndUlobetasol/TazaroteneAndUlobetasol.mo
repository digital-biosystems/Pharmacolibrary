    </table><p>Tazarotene and ulobetasol is a fixed-combination topical medication approved for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults. Tazarotene is a third-generation retinoid that modulates keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation, while ulobetasol is a potent topical corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory properties. The combination is used for short-term topical management of psoriasis and is currently an approved treatment in several countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No peer-reviewed publications currently report full pharmacokinetic models or parameters for the fixed-combination tazarotene and ulobetasol product in humans. Limited data on systemic absorption of the individual components after topical administration suggest low bioavailability, but key PK parameters are not available.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
