    </table><p>Aluminium oxide is an inorganic compound commonly used as an abrasive and as an ingredient in various pharmaceutical and cosmetic preparations. As a drug, it was previously used as an antacid for the treatment of peptic ulcers and dyspepsia, but it is not commonly used or approved as a primary therapeutic agent today due to the availability of safer and more effective alternatives.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic parameters for aluminium oxide as a drug in humans were found in existing literature. Aluminium oxide is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract due to its insolubility in water, and absorption is considered negligible.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
