    </table><p>Cromoglicic acid, also known as cromolyn sodium, is a mast cell stabilizer used mainly for the prophylactic treatment of allergic conditions such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and conjunctivitis. It is not a first-line therapy and its use has declined with the introduction of more effective medications, but it remains approved in several regions for specific indications.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Reported pharmacokinetics in healthy adult volunteers after oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
