    </table><p>Hydrocortisone buteprate is a synthetic corticosteroid used topically for its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive effects in the treatment of various skin disorders, such as eczema and dermatitis. It is a prescription medication and approved for dermatological use in several countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No human pharmacokinetic (PK) studies specifically for hydrocortisone buteprate have been published. Its PK parameters are not available in clinical literature; estimates could be made based on systemic corticosteroid absorption through skin, but topical steroids are intended for minimal systemic absorption.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
