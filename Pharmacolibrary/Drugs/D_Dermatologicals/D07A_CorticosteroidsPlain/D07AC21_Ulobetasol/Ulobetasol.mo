    </table><p>Ulobetasol (also known as halobetasol) is a super high-potency topical corticosteroid used for the treatment of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses, such as plaque psoriasis. It reduces inflammation, itching, and redness. It is typically used as a short-term therapy due to the potential for systemic and local side effects with prolonged use. Ulobetasol is approved for topical application in adults.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published clinical pharmacokinetic studies reporting quantitative plasma PK parameters or compartmental model of ulobetasol in humans are available; PK profile is estimated based on drug class, route, and FDA label statements.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
