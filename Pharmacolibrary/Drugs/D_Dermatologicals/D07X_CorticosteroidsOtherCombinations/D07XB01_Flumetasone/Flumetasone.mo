    </table><p>Flumetasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic properties. It is used topically to treat dermatological conditions, mainly eczema, dermatitis, and other skin inflammations. It is not commonly used systemically, and currently is available as a component in some topical preparations. It is not a first-line corticosteroid and is not approved for systemic use in most regions.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published human pharmacokinetic model found. Parameter estimates are based on class similarities with other topical corticosteroids. Typical pharmacokinetic values for topical corticosteroids in healthy adults are used for approximation.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
