    </table><p>Bifonazole is an imidazole antifungal agent used topically to treat skin infections such as dermatophytosis, candidiasis, and pityriasis versicolor. It is primarily administered as a cream or ointment for cutaneous use. Bifonazole is approved for topical treatment of superficial fungal infections and is still in clinical use today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic model parameters for topical administration in adults, as no published human PK studies with quantifiable systemic parameters exist due to negligible systemic absorption.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
