    </table><p>Benzalkonium is a quaternary ammonium compound widely used as a disinfectant, preservative, and antiseptic. It is most commonly found in topical formulations, eye drops, nasal sprays, and wound dressings. Benzalkonium is not used systemically as a therapeutic agent and is not approved for systemic use in humans.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic parameters are available in the scientific literature for benzalkonium in systemic use or measurable plasma PK; parameters are estimated based on its physicochemical properties and use as a topical/intranasal agent.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
