    </table><p>Methylestrenolone is a synthetic, orally active anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) derived from 17α-methylation of nandrolone. It was developed in the 1960s for potential use as a performance-enhancing substance, but it was never marketed or approved for medical use due to safety concerns and high hepatotoxicity.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published human pharmacokinetic studies available; the following parameters are estimated based on chemical similarity to other 17α-methylated anabolic steroids such as methyltestosterone.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
