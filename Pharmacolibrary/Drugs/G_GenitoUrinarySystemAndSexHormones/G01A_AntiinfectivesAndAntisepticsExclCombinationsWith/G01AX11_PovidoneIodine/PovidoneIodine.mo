    </table><p>Povidone-iodine is a broad-spectrum antiseptic, consisting of the complex of iodine with povidone (polyvinylpyrrolidone), used for topical disinfection of skin, mucous membranes, wounds, and as a vaginal antiseptic. It is not indicated or approved for systemic use, and its primary application remains as a topical anti-infective agent.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published human pharmacokinetic models exist for povidone-iodine administered as a vaginal antiseptic or for any other systemic route, as povidone-iodine is intended for topical or local use and not for systemic application. Available literature indicates negligible systemic absorption when used topically or intravaginally in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
