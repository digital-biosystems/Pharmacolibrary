    </table><p>Lactic acid is an organic acid that occurs naturally in the body as a product of anaerobic glycolysis, but is also used pharmaceutically as a topical agent. It is present in over-the-counter preparations for vaginal disorders such as bacterial vaginosis, often in the form of vaginal tablets, gels, or douches. It is not a systemically acting drug and is not intended for oral or parenteral administration. Lactic acid (G01AD01) is approved for local treatment of vaginal infections and disorders related to pH imbalance.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic models or compartment-based PK parameters for lactic acid when administered intravaginally were identified in the published literature. As lactic acid is a physiologic metabolite and used topically, systemic absorption is minimal and generally not quantified.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Mohideen, M, et al., &amp; Saltzman, WM (2017).
