    </table><p>Styramate is a carbamate derivative that was formerly used as a centrally acting muscle relaxant and as a sedative-hypnotic agent. It was primarily employed in the mid-20th century for its muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant properties, but it is not widely used or approved today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies on humans were identified for styramate. Because styramate is a carbamate sedative, rough pharmacokinetic parameters are estimated by analogy with related agents (e.g., meprobamate) for a typical adult after oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
