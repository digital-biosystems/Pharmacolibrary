It is commonly used in combination with other agents such as analgesics, and sometimes codeine, but this record excludes combinations with psycholeptics. Carisoprodol was approved for short-term use; however, due to potential for abuse and dependence, its usage has declined or is restricted in several countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for adult humans based on known properties of carisoprodol in combination therapy, as no published PK model for carisoprodol combinations excluding psycholeptics could be located.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
