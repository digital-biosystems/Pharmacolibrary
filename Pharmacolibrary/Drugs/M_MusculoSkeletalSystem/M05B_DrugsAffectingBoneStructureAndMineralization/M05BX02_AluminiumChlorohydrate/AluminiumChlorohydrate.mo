    </table><p>Aluminium chlorohydrate is an inorganic compound used primarily as an antiperspirant in topical formulations and occasionally as an adjuvant in vaccines. It is not approved nor commonly used as a systemic drug today, and it has no established use in treatment of bone diseases or conditions covered by ATC code M05BX02. Its most notable pharmaceutical application is in over-the-counter antiperspirant products.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies for aluminium chlorohydrate as a systemically administered medicinal product in humans are available. Estimates are given for systemic absorption following topical administration in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
