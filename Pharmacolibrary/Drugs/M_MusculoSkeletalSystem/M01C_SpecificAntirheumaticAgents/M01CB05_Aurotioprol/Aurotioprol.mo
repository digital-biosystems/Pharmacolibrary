    </table><p>Aurotioprol is an organogold compound that was developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other related inflammatory conditions. It is classified as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) and shares pharmacological properties with other gold-based agents. However, aurotioprol is not currently approved for use, and its use has largely been superseded by safer and more effective medications.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic data are available for aurotioprol in humans or animals. The following pharmacokinetic parameters are provided based on estimated values from similar gold-based DMARDs used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
