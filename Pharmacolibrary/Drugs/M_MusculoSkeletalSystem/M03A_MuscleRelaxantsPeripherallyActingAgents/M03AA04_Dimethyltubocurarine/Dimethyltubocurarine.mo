    </table><p>Dimethyltubocurarine is a neuromuscular blocking agent of the isoquinoline class, historically used as a muscle relaxant during surgical anesthesia and mechanical ventilation. It acts as a non-depolarizing blocker at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. Its use has been largely replaced by newer agents with a better safety profile and it is not commonly approved for modern clinical use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Parameters estimated for typical adult, intravenous administration. No recent or detailed human pharmacokinetic studies published with explicit numerical PK parameters; estimates based on pharmacology texts and related historical sources.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
