    </table><p>Thyroid gland preparations refer to desiccated animal thyroid extracts traditionally used for the treatment of hypothyroidism. These preparations contain both thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), and were formerly a mainstay therapy for hypothyroid patients. Today, their use is limited, having been largely replaced by synthetic levothyroxine, but some patients with hypothyroidism may still receive them.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for oral administration in adult hypothyroid patients based on known PK of main active substances (T4 and T3); no direct literature available for composite thyroid gland preparations as a whole.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
