    </table><p>Pegzilarginase is a recombinant human arginase 1 enzyme, covalently modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG), developed as an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of arginase 1 deficiency, a rare inherited disorder of the urea cycle. It is under clinical investigation, primarily for rare metabolic disorders, and is not approved for general therapeutic use as of 2024.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Population pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and pediatric patients with arginase 1 deficiency, following intravenous administration. Most PK assessments are from clinical trials in subjects with this rare genetic disorder.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
