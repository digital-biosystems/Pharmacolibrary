    </table><p>Glycerol phenylbutyrate is a prodrug for phenylbutyric acid, approved for chronic management of urea cycle disorders. It is used to help control hyperammonemia by delivering phenylacetate, which serves as a nitrogen scavenger. The drug is currently approved and marketed for use in both pediatric and adult populations with urea cycle disorders.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters from published clinical studies in healthy adults and patients with urea cycle disorders. Most data are for oral administration of therapeutic doses.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
