    </table><p>Calcium lactate is a calcium salt used as a calcium supplement to prevent and treat calcium deficiencies. It is also used as a food additive and, less commonly, as a pharmaceutical agent for conditions requiring increased calcium intake. Calcium lactate is considered safe and is approved for use as a supplement, but is rarely used as a primary calcium supplement compared to other forms such as calcium carbonate.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for oral administration in healthy adults, as no specific human pharmacokinetic model publications are available for calcium lactate.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
