The combination is typically used for prevention or treatment of magnesium deficiency and related conditions such as hypomagnesemia, and may also be used in some over-the-counter preparations for constipation or as antacid. The product is approved and widely used as supplement therapy.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for average healthy adult population after oral administration based on known PK for individual magnesium salts and general literature for oral magnesium preparations.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
