    </table><p>Zinc gluconate is a zinc salt of gluconic acid and is commonly used as a dietary supplement for the prevention and treatment of zinc deficiency. It is also present in various over-the-counter cold remedies, lozenges, and nutritional supplements. Zinc is essential for normal cell growth and development, immune function, and wound healing. Zinc gluconate is approved and widely used as a supplement today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No comprehensive human pharmacokinetic models with standard PK parameters available; estimated values below are based on general literature about zinc supplementation in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
