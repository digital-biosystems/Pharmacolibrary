    </table><p>Sulbutiamine is a synthetic derivative of thiamine (vitamin B1) developed for the treatment of asthenia, a condition characterized by chronic fatigue and lack of energy, and has also been researched as a cognitive enhancer and for its potential effects on memory function. Sulbutiamine is not approved for pharmaceutical use in the United States but is available as a supplement in some countries and used as a prescription medication in France and Japan.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for healthy adult subjects after oral administration. There are no peer-reviewed publications providing full compartmental PK models with numerical parameters for sulbutiamine; the following values are estimates based on known properties of thiamine derivatives and published plasma time-concentration curves in non-peer-reviewed reports.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
