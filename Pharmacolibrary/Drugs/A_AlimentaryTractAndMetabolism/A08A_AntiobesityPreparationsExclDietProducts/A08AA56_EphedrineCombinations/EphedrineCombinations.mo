    </table><p>Ephedrine is a sympathomimetic amine used primarily as a decongestant, bronchodilator, and for the treatment of hypotension, especially during anesthesia. It is no longer commonly used as a primary therapeutic agent in many countries due to the availability of safer alternatives, but it is still found in some over-the-counter products in combination with other agents for weight loss and nasal decongestion.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for a standard adult population (both sexes, aged 18-65, without hepatic or renal impairment) assuming oral administration, as no specific published PK study is available for ephedrine in combination (A08AA56) products.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
