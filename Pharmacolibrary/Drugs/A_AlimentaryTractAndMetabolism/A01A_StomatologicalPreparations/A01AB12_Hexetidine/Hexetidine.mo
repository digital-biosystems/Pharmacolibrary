    </table><p>Hexetidine is an antiseptic drug used topically for the treatment of oral and throat infections, commonly available as a mouthwash and lozenge. It acts by inhibiting metabolic processes in bacteria and fungi. Hexetidine is not approved for systemic use and is primarily used today as an over-the-counter oral antiseptic.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters for systemic absorption and disposition of hexetidine in humans are not reported in the scientific literature. Hexetidine is used topically, principally as mouthwash/lozenge, and is intended for minimal systemic absorption.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
