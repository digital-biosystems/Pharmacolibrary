    </table><p>Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid, used for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. In combination products (ATC A01AC54), it is often used as a topical oral anti-inflammatory agent, primarily for conditions affecting the mouth, such as oral ulcers or inflammation. Currently, its topical formulations are approved for short-term management of oral mucosal conditions.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for topical oral administration in general adult population. No specific PK studies for prednisolone, combinations under ATC A01AC54 were found; parameters are based on estimates from systemic administration data adjusted for expected topical exposure.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
