    </table><p>Tocofersolan (also known as TPGS, D-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate) is a water-soluble synthetic derivative of vitamin E. It is used as a vitamin E supplement to treat vitamin E deficiency, especially in patients with fat malabsorption disorders such as cholestatic liver disease, cystic fibrosis, or short bowel syndrome. Tocofersolan is approved for medical use, primarily in pediatric patients with these underlying conditions.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No comprehensive pharmacokinetic studies specific to tocofersolan as an active pharmaceutical ingredient in humans are available in literature; estimated pharmacokinetic values are given based on general properties of orally administered vitamin E derivatives.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
