    </table><p>Retinol, also known as vitamin A, is a fat-soluble vitamin essential for vision, immune function, cell growth, and skin health. It is clinically used in the prevention and treatment of vitamin A deficiency, and in some skin disorders such as acne and psoriasis. Retinol is widely available as an over-the-counter supplement and is approved for use in many countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for healthy adult subjects based on limited literature reports and physiological assumptions, as no formal population PK models or detailed compartmental PK studies were found.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
