    </table><p>Loperamide oxide is the N-oxide metabolite and prodrug of loperamide, which is a synthetic opioid used primarily as an anti-diarrheal agent. Loperamide oxide was developed to reduce central nervous system penetration compared to loperamide and is not approved for current clinical use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic parameters for loperamide oxide in humans found in published literature. The following values are estimated based on its classification as a prodrug of loperamide and general properties of oral opioid receptor agonists used for local gut activity.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
