It is classified under ATC code A03AC02. Its use is now rare or discontinued in most countries, and it is not approved or widely used in modern medicine.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters for humans are not described in scientific literature. The following PK parameters are estimated, based on the known properties of phenothiazine derivatives and promazine-like compounds, for an average adult after a typical oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
