    </table><p>Dimethylaminopropionylphenothiazine (also known as Promezazine) is a phenothiazine derivative formerly used as an antispasmodic drug, primarily for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome. It is classified under ATC code A03AC02. Its use is now rare or discontinued in most countries, and it is not approved or widely used in modern medicine.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters for humans are not described in scientific literature. The following PK parameters are estimated, based on the known properties of phenothiazine derivatives and promazine-like compounds, for an average adult after a typical oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
