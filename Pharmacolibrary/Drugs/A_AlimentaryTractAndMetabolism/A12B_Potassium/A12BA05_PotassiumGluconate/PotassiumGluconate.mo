    </table><p>Potassium gluconate is an oral mineral supplement used to treat or prevent low levels of potassium (hypokalemia) in the blood. It is commonly used as a dietary supplement, particularly in patients with conditions or treatments that deplete potassium such as certain diuretics. It is not a first-line therapy for acute hypokalemia and is mainly available in over-the-counter forms. The drug is approved for use as a potassium supplement, though oral potassium chloride is more frequently used in clinical practice.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No detailed pharmacokinetic (PK) studies with compartmental models for potassium gluconate in healthy adults or patients could be identified in peer-reviewed literature. The PK parameters are estimated based on known physiology of potassium and gluconate salts and general oral potassium salt behavior.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
