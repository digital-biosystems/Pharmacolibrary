    </table><p>Hydroxocobalamin is a form of vitamin B12, used primarily for the treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency and as an antidote to cyanide poisoning. In combination products (ATC code B03BA53), it may be co-formulated with other vitamins or minerals for parenteral supplementation, but such combinations are not widely approved or available in all countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters for hydroxocobalamin, combinations (ATC B03BA53) have not been specifically published. The following estimates are based on the pharmacokinetics of hydroxocobalamin monotherapy in healthy adults after intravenous administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
