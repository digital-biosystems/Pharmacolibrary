    </table><p>Cyanocobalamin, commonly known as vitamin B12, is an essential water-soluble vitamin that is used to treat and prevent vitamin B12 deficiency. It is crucial for normal functioning of the brain, nerves, and blood cells. In combinations (ATC: B03BA51), it may be co-formulated with other nutrients (often with folic acid or other B vitamins) for treatment of various anemias and deficiencies. Cyanocobalamin is still approved and widely used as both a therapeutic agent and dietary supplement.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are estimated for healthy adult individuals, as no specific published references for combination products are available.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
