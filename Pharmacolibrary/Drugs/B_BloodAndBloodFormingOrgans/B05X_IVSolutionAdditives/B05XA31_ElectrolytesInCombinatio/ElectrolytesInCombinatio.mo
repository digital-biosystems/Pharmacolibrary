    </table><p>A combination solution containing electrolytes (such as sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, or magnesium), sometimes mixed with carbohydrates or other agents, used for intravenous fluid replacement therapy in situations such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or to maintain or restore fluid balance in clinical settings. These combinations are approved and routinely used for intravenous infusion, particularly in hospitals.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies are directly available for 'electrolytes in combination with other drugs' as a group under ATC code B05XA31 in standard scientific literature. The pharmacokinetic characteristics are estimated based on the behavior of electrolytes following intravenous administration in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>el-Mougi, M, et al., &amp; Pierce, NF (1996).
