It acts locally to promote coagulation, often applied during surgery or in wound care. The compound is not widely approved as an active pharmaceutical ingredient in major regulatory regions and is currently used in select medical settings, primarily in Europe.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic model or quantitative data is available for any population, adult or pediatric, and all parameters are estimated based on physicochemical properties of large, hydrophilic polysaccharides and expected local action.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
