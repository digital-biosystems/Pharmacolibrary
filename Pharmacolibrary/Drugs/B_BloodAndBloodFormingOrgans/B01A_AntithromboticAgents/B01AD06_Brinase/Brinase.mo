    </table><p>Brinase (streptokinase from Streptomyces griseus) is a fibrinolytic enzyme formerly used as a thrombolytic agent for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction and other thromboembolic events. Brinase is a proteolytic enzyme but is no longer widely used today due to safety and efficacy concerns, and the drug is not presently approved for clinical use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published sources report detailed pharmacokinetic parameters for brinase in humans. The following are plausible estimates based on typical intravenous enzyme thrombolytics.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
