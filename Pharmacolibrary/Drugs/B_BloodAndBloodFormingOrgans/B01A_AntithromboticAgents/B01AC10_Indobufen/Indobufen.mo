    </table><p>Indobufen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with antiplatelet properties, primarily used for the prevention of thromboembolic disorders such as in patients with coronary artery disease and after vascular surgery. It acts as a reversible inhibitor of platelet cyclooxygenase and is approved and used in some countries, particularly in Europe, though it is not universally available worldwide.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters based on studies in healthy adult volunteers (both male and female), typically after single oral doses.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
