    </table><p>Sodium citrate is an alkalinizing agent and anticoagulant used mainly to treat metabolic acidosis, as a buffer in various settings, and as an additive to blood products to prevent coagulation by chelating calcium. It is also used as a urine alkalizer and to treat renal tubular acidosis. Sodium citrate is an approved drug and is widely used in medical settings today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for healthy adults, as literature with precise PK models reporting specific model parameters (such as compartmental volumes and clearance values) is lacking; parameter values are estimated based on known pharmacokinetic behavior of citrate in humans.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
