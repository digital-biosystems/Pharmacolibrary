These combinations frequently contain ions such as sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and may include glucose or other adjuvants. These are widely approved and commonly used in hospital and emergency medicine.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are generally not well characterized or specified for these mixtures, because the pharmacokinetics of electrolytes depend on the individual ions and clinical status of a patient. No published studies directly reporting compartmental pharmacokinetic models or parameters for this ATC code combination have been identified in the literature.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>el-Mougi, M, et al., &amp; Pierce, NF (1996).
