    </table><p>Ethotoin is a hydantoin anticonvulsant that was historically used to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures, particularly in cases of generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) and complex partial seizures. Its use has largely been discontinued or replaced by other antiepileptic drugs due to its lower efficacy and safety concerns, and it is not widely approved or marketed today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for adult patients following oral administration, as no primary pharmacokinetic studies with reported parameters in existing literature were found.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
