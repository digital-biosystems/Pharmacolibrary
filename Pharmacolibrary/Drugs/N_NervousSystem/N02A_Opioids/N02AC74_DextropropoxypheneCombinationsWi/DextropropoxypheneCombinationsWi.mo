Due to concerns over its safety, particularly risk of fatal overdose and cardiac toxicity, dextropropoxyphene-containing products have been withdrawn or banned in several countries and are not approved for use in many regions today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies report parameters specifically for dextropropoxyphene in combination with psycholeptics (ATC N02AC74); estimates below based on known single-agent pharmacokinetics in healthy adults after oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
