    </table><p>Medifoxamine is an atypical antidepressant that was previously used primarily in France and some other countries. It functions mainly as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) as well as a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist. It is no longer marketed or approved for therapeutic use due to concerns about adverse effects, including hepatotoxicity.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for a typical adult based on known properties of similar SNRIs; no original human PK studies publicly available.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
