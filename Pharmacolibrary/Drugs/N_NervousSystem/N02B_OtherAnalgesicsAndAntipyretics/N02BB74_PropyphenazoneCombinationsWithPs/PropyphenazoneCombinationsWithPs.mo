Its use has declined or been withdrawn in many countries due to rare but serious side effects such as agranulocytosis. These fixed combinations are not widely approved for use today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published population pharmacokinetic studies are available specifically for combinations of propyphenazone with psycholeptics (ATC N02BB74). The estimates below are based on pharmacokinetics of propyphenazone alone in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
