    </table><p>Phenazone (also known as antipyrine) is a non-opioid analgesic and antipyretic formerly used for the relief of pain and fever. It is a pyrazolone derivative. Its use today is rare in many countries, having been largely replaced by safer and more effective agents, though it remains a classic model drug in pharmacokinetics studies due to well-established metabolic pathways.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters reported for healthy adult volunteers (mixed sex, typical age 20-40 years) after a single oral dose.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
