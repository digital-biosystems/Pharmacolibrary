    </table><p>Dichloralphenazone is a sedative-hypnotic compound composed of a 1:2 molar mixture of chloral hydrate and phenazone (antipyrine). It has been used primarily as an ingredient in combination medications for the short-term treatment of tension and vascular headaches (e.g., migraine). It is not widely used as a monotherapy and is rarely used today due to the availability of safer alternatives; its clinical use has declined in many countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic studies found in the literature for dichloralphenazone as a single entity. Estimates below are based on assumptions from its known components, typical clinical dosage, and standard oral absorption parameters in adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
