    </table><p>Reposal, with ATC code N05CA12, is a barbituric acid derivative (barbiturate) that was previously used as a sedative and hypnotic. It is no longer commonly used or approved for medical use today due to safety concerns and the availability of safer alternatives.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No primary pharmacokinetic studies or published PK parameters for reposal were identified. The following are general estimates based on pharmacokinetic profiles of similar barbiturates (sedative-hypnotics) in healthy adult individuals.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
