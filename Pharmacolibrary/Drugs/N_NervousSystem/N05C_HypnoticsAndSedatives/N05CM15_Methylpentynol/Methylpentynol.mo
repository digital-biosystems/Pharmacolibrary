    </table><p>Methylpentynol is a sedative-hypnotic drug which was historically used as an anxiolytic and hypnotic. It acts as a central nervous system depressant. Methylpentynol is no longer widely used today due to the availability of safer alternatives and concerns about its safety profile.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published human pharmacokinetic studies reporting parameter values for methylpentynol were found. The following is an estimated one-compartment oral model with literature-based typical values for similar sedative-hypnotic drugs.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
