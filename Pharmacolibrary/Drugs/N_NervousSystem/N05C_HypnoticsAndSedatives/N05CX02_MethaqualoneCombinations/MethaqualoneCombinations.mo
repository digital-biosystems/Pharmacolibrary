    </table><p>Methaqualone is a sedative and hypnotic medication that was previously prescribed for the treatment of insomnia and anxiety. It is a quinazolinone derivative and was commonly used in combination with other drugs as a sleeping aid. Due to its high abuse potential and risk of addiction, it has been withdrawn or banned in many countries and is not approved for medical use today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are estimated for oral administration in healthy adult subjects due to lack of published clinical PK data for methaqualone combinations.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
