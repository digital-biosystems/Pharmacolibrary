    </table><p>Mephenoxalone is a muscle relaxant and anxiolytic agent, with mild sedative properties, previously used for the symptomatic relief of muscle spasms and anxiety-related muscle tension. It has been used mainly in combination with analgesics for musculoskeletal pain; however, it is not widely approved or used today due to the development of more effective and safer alternatives.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No original pharmacokinetic studies or primary human clinical data are available in the published literature. The following are estimated parameters for a healthy adult based on analogy with other muscle relaxants and structural analogues.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
