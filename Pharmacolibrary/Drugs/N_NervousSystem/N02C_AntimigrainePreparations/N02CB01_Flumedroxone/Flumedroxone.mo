    </table><p>Flumedroxone is a synthetic steroidal compound classified as a progestogen. It is primarily known as an analgesic that was previously studied or used for pain relief; however, it is not widely approved or marketed today, and its clinical use is largely historical.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters for flumedroxone have not been reported in the scientific literature. The information below represents a best-effort estimate based on the pharmacokinetic profiles of structurally related synthetic progestogens and general properties of oral steroidal drugs.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
