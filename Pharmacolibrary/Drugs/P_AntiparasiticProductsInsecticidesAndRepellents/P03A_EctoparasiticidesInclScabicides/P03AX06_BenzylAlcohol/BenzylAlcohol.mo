    </table><p>Benzyl alcohol is an aromatic alcohol used primarily as a preservative in pharmaceutical formulations, as a topical antiparasitic agent for the treatment of head lice, and previously as a local anesthetic. Its use as a preservative is still approved, but its use as a local anesthetic has largely been replaced due to toxicity concerns.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for healthy adult subjects, as no direct human PK model studies with clinically relevant dosing could be identified.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
