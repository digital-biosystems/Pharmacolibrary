    </table><p>Diethyltoluamide (DEET) is an insect repellent commonly used for the prevention of bites from mosquitoes, ticks, and other biting insects. It is topically applied, primarily for self-protection in areas with vector-borne diseases. DEET is approved and widely used globally for human use on skin or clothing.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic data for DEET in humans is limited. Available information suggests DEET is absorbed through the skin after topical application, with a portion undergoing dermal absorption and subsequent metabolism. PK parameters are not routinely reported in published research. The following values are estimated based on limited dermal absorption studies in adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
