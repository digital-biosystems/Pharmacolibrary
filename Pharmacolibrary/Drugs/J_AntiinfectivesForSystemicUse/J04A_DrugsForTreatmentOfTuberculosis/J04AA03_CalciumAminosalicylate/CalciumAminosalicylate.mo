    </table><p>Calcium aminosalicylate, also known as calcium para-aminosalicylate, is a salt form of para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS). It is an antibacterial agent historically used as a second-line drug in the treatment of tuberculosis, particularly for strains resistant to first-line agents. Its use has largely declined due to the development of more effective and better-tolerated therapies.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Due to the lack of recent published pharmacokinetic (PK) studies specific to calcium aminosalicylate, PK parameters are estimated based on older data for para-aminosalicylic acid and its salts in adult subjects receiving oral doses.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
