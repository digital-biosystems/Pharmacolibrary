    </table><p>Enterovirus 71 vaccines are inactivated vaccines developed to prevent infection by enterovirus 71 (EV71), a major cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), particularly in children. Several inactivated vaccines have been developed and approved in China, primarily for pediatric use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic (PK) data directly reported in published literature, as vaccines are typically evaluated by immunogenicity and safety rather than absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion pharmacokinetic parameters.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
