It is used for immunization against these four viral diseases and is approved for use in children and adults as part of routine vaccination schedules worldwide.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>As a live attenuated viral vaccine, the pharmacokinetics are not characterized in terms of traditional absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) parameters used for small molecule drugs or typical biologics. Instead, the vaccine is administered to induce immune response. No published scientific literature reports formal pharmacokinetic parameters for this drug, as the vaccine viruses replicate locally and induce immunity rather than follow conventional drug PK.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
