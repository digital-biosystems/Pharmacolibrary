It induces immunity by stimulating the production of neutralizing antibodies without causing disease. IPV is currently widely used globally in routine immunization schedules as part of poliomyelitis eradication programs.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No clinical pharmacokinetic data available, as IPV is a vaccine and acts via immune stimulation rather than classic pharmacokinetic processes involving absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Pharmacokinetic modeling is not applicable.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
