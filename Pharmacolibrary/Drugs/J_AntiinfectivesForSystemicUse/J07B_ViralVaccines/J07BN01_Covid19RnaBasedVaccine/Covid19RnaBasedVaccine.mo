    </table><p>COVID-19, RNA-based vaccines (such as those developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna) are mRNA vaccines that instruct cells to produce the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which induces an immune response. These vaccines are approved and widely used globally for the prevention of COVID-19.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for healthy adult individuals; published literature does not report standard PK values for mRNA vaccines due to their mechanism of action and rapid degradation.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
