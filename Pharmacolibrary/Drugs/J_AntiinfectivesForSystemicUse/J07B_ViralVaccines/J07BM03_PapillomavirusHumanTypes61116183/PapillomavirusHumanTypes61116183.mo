It is widely approved and used for immunization to reduce HPV-related diseases globally.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No referenced publication is available reporting classic pharmacokinetic parameters for the nonavalent HPV vaccine, as it is a virus-like particle vaccine and not a small molecule drug. Vaccine pharmacokinetics are generally not quantified using typical PK parameters, as the vaccine induces an immune response rather than undergoing systemic distribution, metabolism, and excretion.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
