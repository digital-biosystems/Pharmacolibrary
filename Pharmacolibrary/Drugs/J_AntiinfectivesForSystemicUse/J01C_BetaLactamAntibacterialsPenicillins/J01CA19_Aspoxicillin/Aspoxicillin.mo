    </table><p>Aspoxicillin is a semi-synthetic broad-spectrum penicillin antibiotic related to ampicillin, formerly developed for the treatment of a range of bacterial infections. It is primarily active against gram-positive and some gram-negative organisms. It has not been widely approved for clinical use and is not commonly used in current practice.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No original pharmacokinetic studies or clinical PK reports for aspoxicillin were found in the published literature. The following pharmacokinetic parameters are estimated based on class-related penicillins such as ampicillin in healthy adult individuals.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
