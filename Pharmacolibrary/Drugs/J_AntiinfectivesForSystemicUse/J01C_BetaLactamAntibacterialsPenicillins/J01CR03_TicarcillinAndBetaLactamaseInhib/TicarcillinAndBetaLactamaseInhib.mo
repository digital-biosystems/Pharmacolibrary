The combination is indicated for the treatment of various serious bacterial infections, including lower respiratory tract, urinary tract, intra-abdominal, and gynecological infections. In many countries, this formulation has been discontinued or is used less commonly today due to the development of newer agents.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic estimates for ticarcillin in combination with clavulanic acid in healthy adults, intravenous administration.
