    </table><p>Cefuroxime and metronidazole (ATC code J01RA03) is a fixed-dose combination of two antimicrobial agents. Cefuroxime is a second-generation cephalosporin antibiotic effective against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, mainly used for perioperative prophylaxis and treatment of various infections. Metronidazole is an antiprotozoal and antibacterial agent particularly effective against anaerobic bacteria and protozoa, widely used for intra-abdominal and gynecological infections. This combination is used to provide broad-spectrum coverage for mixed infections, including surgical prophylaxis and treatment of intra-abdominal infections. Both drugs are approved and used in clinical practice.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic models were found for the fixed-dose cefuroxime and metronidazole combination. Instead, typical adult pharmacokinetic parameters for intravenous administration were estimated from literature for each component.</p><h4>References</h4><ol><li><p>Sullins, AK, &amp; Abdel-Rahman, SM (2013).
