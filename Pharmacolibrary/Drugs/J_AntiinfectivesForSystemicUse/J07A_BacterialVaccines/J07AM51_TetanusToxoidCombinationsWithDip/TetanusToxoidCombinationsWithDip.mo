These vaccines are widely approved and used globally in both pediatric and adult populations as part of routine immunization schedules and for post-exposure prophylaxis.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No specific pharmacokinetic (PK) data for tetanus toxoid, combinations with diphtheria toxoid vaccines exist in published sources, as these are protein-based vaccines intended to induce immunogenicity rather than classical absorption/distribution/elimination as with small molecule drugs. Typical PK studies for these vaccines are not performed, especially regarding systemic distribution following intramuscular administration. The following is a conceptual estimate for healthy adults following intramuscular injection.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
