    </table><p>Multicomponent meningococcus B vaccine (commonly known as 4CMenB) is a recombinant protein vaccine used to provide active immunization against Neisseria meningitidis group B (meningococcus B) infection. It is approved for use in many countries for the prevention of invasive meningococcal disease caused by serogroup B in infants, children, adolescents, and adults.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>There are no published pharmacokinetic studies or pharmacokinetic parameter reports for the multicomponent meningococcus B vaccine (ATC J07AH09) in any demographic, as vaccines are generally not evaluated with classical pharmacokinetics due to their mechanism of action involving immunogenicity rather than systemic bioavailability of a single drug entity.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
