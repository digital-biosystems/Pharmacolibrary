It is used to induce immunity against invasive diseases caused by these bacteria, such as pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis in infants and young children. The vaccine is approved and in clinical use for pediatric immunization, particularly in schedules for young children under the age of 5.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No specific pharmacokinetic parameters (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) are reported for this vaccine in the literature, as vaccines composed of polysaccharide-protein conjugates function primarily by immunogenicity and not classical pharmacokinetics. Most published data focus on immunogenicity and clinical efficacy rather than serum concentrations or elimination rates. Typical study participants are healthy infants or children without underlying immunodeficiency.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
