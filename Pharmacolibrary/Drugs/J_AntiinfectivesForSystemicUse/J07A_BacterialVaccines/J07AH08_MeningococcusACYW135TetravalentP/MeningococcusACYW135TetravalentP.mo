It induces the production of protective antibodies against meningococcal infection, and is widely approved and used for prevention of invasive meningococcal disease in children, adolescents, and adults.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic model parameters (clearance, volume of distribution, etc.) for the conjugated tetravalent meningococcal vaccine; typically does not undergo classical PK evaluation as for small-molecule drugs due to its vaccine nature and immunogenic mechanism.
