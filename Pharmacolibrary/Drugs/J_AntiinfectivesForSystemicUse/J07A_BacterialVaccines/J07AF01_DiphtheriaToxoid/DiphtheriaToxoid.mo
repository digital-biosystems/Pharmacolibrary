    </table><p>Diphtheria toxoid is an inactivated toxin derived from Corynebacterium diphtheriae used as an antigen in vaccines to provide immunization against diphtheria, a serious bacterial infection. It is widely used in childhood and adult vaccine formulations such as DTP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) and remains an approved immunization agent worldwide.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No peer-reviewed publication was found reporting detailed pharmacokinetic parameters of diphtheria toxoid in humans. As a protein antigen vaccine administered intramuscularly, absorption is believed to occur via lymphatic uptake, with slow release from the site of injection and immune processing rather than classic distribution/elimination as seen with small molecule drugs. Standard doses are administered in healthy pediatric and adult populations.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
