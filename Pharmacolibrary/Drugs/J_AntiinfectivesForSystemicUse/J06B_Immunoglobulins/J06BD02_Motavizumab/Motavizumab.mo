    </table><p>Motavizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the fusion (F) protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). It was developed for the prevention of RSV infection in high-risk infants and children; however, motavizumab is not currently approved for use due to regulatory concerns and insufficient demonstration of clinical benefit over palivizumab.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for typical healthy pediatric patients based on reported data for IgG monoclonal antibodies of similar type, as there are no peer-reviewed, published PK parameters specifically for motavizumab.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
