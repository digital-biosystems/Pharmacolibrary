    </table><p>Casirivimab and imdevimab are recombinant human monoclonal antibodies that bind to non-overlapping epitopes of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, thereby blocking viral entry into human cells. They are used together as a combination therapy for the treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19. The combination received emergency use authorization during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for healthy adults and COVID-19 patients; the following parameters are representative values from available regulatory and pharmacology reviews.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
