    </table><p>Deslanoside is a cardiac glycoside formerly used in the treatment of heart failure and certain cardiac arrhythmias, similar to digitoxin and digoxin. It acts by inhibiting the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, leading to increased intracellular calcium and enhanced cardiac contractility. Currently, deslanoside is rarely used, having been largely replaced by other glycosides in clinical practice.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for deslanoside in healthy adults, based on literature review and pharmacological similarity to other cardiac glycosides.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
