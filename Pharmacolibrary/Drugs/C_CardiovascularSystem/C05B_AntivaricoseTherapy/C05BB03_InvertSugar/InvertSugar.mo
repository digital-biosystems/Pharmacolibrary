    </table><p>Invert sugar is a mixture of glucose and fructose produced by the hydrolysis of sucrose. It has been used historically as a plasma volume expander and as a source of carbohydrate calories in parenteral nutrition, particularly when glucose administration is undesirable (e.g., hereditary fructose intolerance). It is not a commonly approved drug for clinical use today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic parameters for invert sugar (ATC code C05BB03) could be found in published literature for administration as a medicinal product in humans.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
