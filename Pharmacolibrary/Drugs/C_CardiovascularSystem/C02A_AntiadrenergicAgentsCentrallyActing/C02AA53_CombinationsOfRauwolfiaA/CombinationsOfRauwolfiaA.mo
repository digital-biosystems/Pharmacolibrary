    </table><p>Combinations of Rauwolfia alkaloids are antihypertensive agents that were commonly used to treat high blood pressure, particularly in the mid-20th century. These combinations usually contain reserpine together with other Rauwolfia alkaloids, and sometimes are combined with diuretics or other antihypertensive agents. This combination is rarely used in clinical practice today due to the availability of newer agents and concerns over adverse effects, but it is still listed in some therapeutic guidelines as an option.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters based on available literature data for reserpine (as one of the main constituents) in healthy adults. No direct (combination product) PK studies identified.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
