PETN is sometimes available in combination preparations with other cardiovascular drugs. While PETN has historical and regional clinical use (primarily in Europe), it is not widely approved or commonly used in all countries today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are estimated based on published PETN monotherapy data in healthy adults, as no direct published pharmacokinetics for combinations (ATC C01DA55) could be identified.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
