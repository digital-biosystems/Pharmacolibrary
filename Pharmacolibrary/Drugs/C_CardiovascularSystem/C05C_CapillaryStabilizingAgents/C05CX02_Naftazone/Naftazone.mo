    </table><p>Naftazone is a vasoactive drug formerly used for the treatment of peripheral vascular diseases, including chronic venous insufficiency and hemorrhoids, mainly in some European and Asian countries. It is a derivative of naphthoquinone. The use of naftazone has declined and it is not widely approved or available in many markets today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic parameters for naftazone were identified in literature databases.
