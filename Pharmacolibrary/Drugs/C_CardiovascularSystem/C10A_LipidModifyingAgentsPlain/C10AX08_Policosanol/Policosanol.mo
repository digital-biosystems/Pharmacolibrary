    </table><p>Policosanol is a mixture of long-chain primary aliphatic alcohols derived from plant waxes, commonly including octacosanol as the main component. It has been marketed as a lipid-lowering agent for treatment of hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular risk management, but its efficacy and regulatory approval is controversial and not approved by major agencies such as FDA or EMA.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published human pharmacokinetic models with quantifiable parameters are available for policosanol. Available data are limited to general statements about absorption and metabolism after oral administration in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
