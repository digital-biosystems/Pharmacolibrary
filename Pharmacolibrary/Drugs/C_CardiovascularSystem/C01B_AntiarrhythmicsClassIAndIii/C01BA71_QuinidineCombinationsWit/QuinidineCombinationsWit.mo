    </table><p>Quinidine is an antiarrhythmic drug used primarily for the treatment of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. It is also known for its role as a CYP2D6 inhibitor. Combinations with psycholeptics (such as antipsychotics or tranquilizers) have been used historically for treatment-resistant psychiatric conditions involving comorbid cardiac issues, but are not widely used or approved in current practice due to safety concerns and availability of better alternatives.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetics for adult population receiving quinidine in combination with psycholeptics; values are based on quinidine monotherapy due to lack of published data for the combination.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
