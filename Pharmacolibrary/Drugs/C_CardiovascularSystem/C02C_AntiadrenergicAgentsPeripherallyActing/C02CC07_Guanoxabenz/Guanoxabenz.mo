    </table><p>Guanoxabenz is a centrally acting antihypertensive drug of the imidazoline/oxazoline class, structurally related to guanfacine and clonidine. It acts as an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist and was previously used in the management of high blood pressure, but is no longer widely approved or used in clinical practice.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No specific published pharmacokinetic model or detailed PK parameters for humans were identified in peer-reviewed articles. Estimates below are made based on the pharmacokinetic behavior of closely related drugs (e.g., clonidine, guanfacine) in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
