Such combinations have historically been used in the treatment of hypertension, but the use of reserpine has declined with the advent of more modern antihypertensive therapies. Currently, resperine combination products are rarely used and not considered first-line therapy in most international guidelines.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are estimated for the combination of reserpine and diuretics (representing typical adult population, oral administration), as no published studies specifically address PK of this fixed-dose combination. Parameters are based on typical single-agent PK for reserpine and known properties of oral diuretics in fixed combinations.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
