    </table><p>Trypan blue is a diazo dye often used as a vital stain to selectively color dead tissues or cells blue. It has been historically used in medicine as a diagnostic agent and is currently approved for use in ophthalmic surgery, particularly in cataract surgery to stain the anterior capsule for enhanced visualization during capsulorhexis.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No dedicated pharmacokinetic studies in humans are available for trypan blue. The drug is typically used as a single intraocular dose during cataract surgery, and systemic exposure is considered minimal. Parameters below are estimated/extrapolated as no actual clinical PK model is published.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
