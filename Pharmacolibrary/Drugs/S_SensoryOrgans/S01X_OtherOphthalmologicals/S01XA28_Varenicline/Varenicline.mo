    </table><p>Varenicline is a partial agonist at the α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, used as a smoking cessation aid to reduce nicotine craving and withdrawal symptoms. It is approved for use in many countries and is generally administered orally.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic data for varenicline ophthalmic solution (S01XA28) is not available in published sources. Estimated parameters are derived based on extrapolation from oral varenicline, as there are currently no peer-reviewed studies reporting PK for the ocular route.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
