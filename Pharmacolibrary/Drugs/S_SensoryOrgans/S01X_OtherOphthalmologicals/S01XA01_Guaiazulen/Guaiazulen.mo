    </table><p>Guaiazulen (guaiazulene) is a dark blue crystalline hydrocarbon derived from azulene, found in oil of guaiac and chamomile oil. It has anti-inflammatory and soothing properties and is primarily used in topical formulations for dermatological conditions, and in ophthalmic solutions for its mild anti-inflammatory effect. It is not widely used systemically and has very limited use as a modern therapeutic drug, with only rare use in some countries (not widely approved for systemic administration).</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic (PK) studies could be identified for guaiazulen in humans. The following are estimates based on physicochemical properties and its local use in ophthalmic or topical formulations.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
