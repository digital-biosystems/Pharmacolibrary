    </table><p>Aceclidine is a parasympathomimetic miotic agent primarily used in ophthalmology for the treatment of glaucoma and other ocular conditions to reduce intraocular pressure. It acts as a muscarinic receptor agonist. Currently, aceclidine is not widely used and is not approved in many countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic parameters for aceclidine in combination products with ATC code S01EB58 were identified in the literature. The following PK parameters are estimated for a typical adult using topical ocular administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
