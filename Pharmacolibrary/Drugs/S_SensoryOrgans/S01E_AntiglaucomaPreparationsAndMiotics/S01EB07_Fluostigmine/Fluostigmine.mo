    </table><p>Fluostigmine is a synthetic organophosphate compound and a potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, related to physostigmine. It was historically investigated for its use in glaucoma management as a miotic agent in ophthalmology but is not currently approved for therapeutic use and is rarely used in clinical practice due to toxicity concerns.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic data were found for fluostigmine in humans. The following parameters are estimated based on analogous acetylcholinesterase inhibitors used in ophthalmology, such as physostigmine and neostigmine.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
