    </table><p>Paraoxon is an organophosphate compound, known primarily as the active and highly toxic metabolite of parathion, once used as a pesticide. It is a potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Paraoxon is not approved for therapeutic use in humans and is considered a hazardous chemical due to its toxicity.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic models specifically for paraoxon in humans are available. The following values are rough estimates based on animal models and analogy to similar organophosphate compounds.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
