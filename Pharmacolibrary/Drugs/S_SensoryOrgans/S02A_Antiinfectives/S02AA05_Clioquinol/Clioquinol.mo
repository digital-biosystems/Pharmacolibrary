    </table><p>Clioquinol is an antifungal and antibacterial agent formerly used as a topical and oral treatment for a range of infections, including dermatological and ear infections, and certain protozoal parasitic diseases. Due to safety concerns, including subacute myelo-optic neuropathy (SMON), its use systemically has been largely discontinued and it is now primarily available for topical or otic use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters for systemic (oral) or local (otic, topical) use in humans are not well-characterized in the published literature. No comprehensive PK data are available; estimates are presented based on general properties of similar compounds and limited case reports.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
