    </table><p>A combination of polymyxin B and neomycin (ATC code S02DA30), used as an otic (ear) solution for the treatment of bacterial infections of the external ear. Such combinations typically include hydrocortisone or other anti-inflammatory agents. While once widely used, some of these combinations have become less common in modern therapy, but are still available in some regions and formulations.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic data found specifically for the combination product polymyxin B and neomycin administered otically in healthy adults or children. Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated based on data available for individual drugs administered via systemic or topical routes; minimal systemic absorption expected with otic administration unless tympanic membrane is perforated.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
