These combinations typically contain an antibiotic (such as chloramphenicol) and may include corticosteroids or other agents. Their use is primarily for external eye infections to reduce both inflammation and microbial load. Approval and usage may vary by formulation and country.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic data specific to combinations in the ATC category S01AA20 could be found. Available formulations are administered locally (ophthalmic) and are expected to have minimal systemic absorption in healthy adults.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
