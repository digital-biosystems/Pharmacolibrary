    </table><p>Dibrompropamidine is an aromatic diamidine antiseptic and disinfectant, formerly used as the isethionate salt in ophthalmic solutions and ointments for the treatment of superficial eye infections such as conjunctivitis and blepharitis. Its current usage is rare and it is not widely approved for clinical use today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic data (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) for dibrompropamidine have been identified in primary literature or standard PK sources for any population (adults, children, healthy or diseased individuals), likely due to its restricted use to topical ophthalmic administration and limited systemic absorption.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
