    </table><p>Polihexanide (also known as polyhexanide or polyhexamethylene biguanide, PHMB) is a polymeric biguanide antiseptic agent primarily used for wound care, disinfection, and ophthalmologic purposes such as in eye drops for conjunctivitis or infection prophylaxis. It is not systemically approved as a therapeutic agent and is mainly used topically due to its local effects and presumed low systemic absorption.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic data were identified for systemic or ophthalmologic application in humans. Because polihexanide is applied topically or as eye drops and is a high molecular weight polymer with poor absorption, systemic exposure is presumed negligible. No compartmental PK model or parameters are established.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
