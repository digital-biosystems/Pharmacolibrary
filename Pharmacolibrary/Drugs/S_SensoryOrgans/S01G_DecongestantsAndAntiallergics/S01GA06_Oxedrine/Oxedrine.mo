    </table><p>Oxedrine (also known as synephrine) is a sympathomimetic agent that acts as an adrenergic agonist, primarily at alpha-adrenergic receptors. It has been used in the past for its vasoconstrictive and pressor effects, especially as a mydriatic or vasoconstrictor in ophthalmic preparations. Currently, its use in mainstream medicine has diminished and it is not widely approved or used today as a first-line therapy.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No pharmacokinetic studies of oxedrine for ophthalmologic or systemic use with reported parameters found in peer-reviewed literature. The following parameters are estimated based on general knowledge of adrenergic agonist pharmacokinetics of similar drugs.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
