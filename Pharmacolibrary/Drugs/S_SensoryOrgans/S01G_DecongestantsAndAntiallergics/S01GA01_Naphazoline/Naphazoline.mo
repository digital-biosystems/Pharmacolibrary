    </table><p>Naphazoline is an imidazoline derivative used primarily as a topical decongestant in ophthalmic and nasal preparations. It is used to relieve redness and swelling associated with minor eye irritations and nasal congestion. Naphazoline is approved for over-the-counter use in many countries in eye drops, but some formulations have restricted use due to potential side effects.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic parameters for naphazoline were identified in humans from available literature; the following values are estimates based on its pharmacological class, usage, and route of administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
