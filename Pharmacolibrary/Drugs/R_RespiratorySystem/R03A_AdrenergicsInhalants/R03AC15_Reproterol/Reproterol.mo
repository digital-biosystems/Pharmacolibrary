    </table><p>Reproterol is a short-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonist used for the treatment of asthma and other pulmonary diseases. It is employed as a bronchodilator and is most commonly administered by inhalation or intravenously in acute asthma attacks. Its use is currently approved in some countries but not widely available in all regions.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published human pharmacokinetic studies available for reproterol; all values below are estimates extrapolated from general knowledge of similar short-acting β2-agonists and limited product information for typical adult patients.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
