    </table><p>Rimiterol is a short-acting beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist previously used as a bronchodilator in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is not widely used or approved in current clinical practice, having largely been replaced by other beta-2 agonists such as salbutamol.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters were not identified in published literature for any population. Reported values are plausible estimates based on similarity to other short-acting beta-2 agonists orally inhaled, such as salbutamol, and available secondary sources.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
