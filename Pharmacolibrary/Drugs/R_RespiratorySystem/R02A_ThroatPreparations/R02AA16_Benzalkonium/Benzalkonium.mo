    </table><p>Benzalkonium is a quaternary ammonium compound used as a disinfectant and antiseptic. It is used in various topical formulations, such as throat lozenges and sprays, eye drops, and as a preservative in nasal sprays and ophthalmic solutions. It is not typically used systemically and does not have systemic therapeutic indications; its use is mainly for local antiseptic effects. It is not approved for systemic use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No systemic pharmacokinetic data available in humans; used locally/topically and not intended for systemic exposure. Parameters estimated based on reference range for quaternary ammonium compounds if any absorption occurs (very low bioavailability).</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
