    </table><p>Cromoglicic acid (also known as cromolyn sodium) is a mast cell stabilizer used primarily for the prevention and treatment of allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and asthma. It works by inhibiting the degranulation of mast cells, thereby preventing the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine. Although widely used in the past for asthma prophylaxis, its use has declined with the advent of newer therapies. It remains approved and available for allergic ocular and nasal conditions in several countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters reported in healthy adult volunteers following inhaled and oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
