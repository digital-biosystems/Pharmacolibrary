    </table><p>Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan widely distributed throughout connective, epithelial, and neural tissues. As a drug, it is commonly used in the treatment of osteoarthritis (via intra-articular injection), as an adjunct in ophthalmic surgery, for wound healing, and as a moisturizer in topical formulations. Intranasal formulations (ATC code R01AX09) have been investigated for improving nasal mucosa hydration. Hyaluronic acid is generally regarded as safe and is used in a variety of medical devices and health products, but is not widely approved as a systemic drug.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for hyaluronic acid administered intranasally in adult subjects. No direct pharmacokinetic studies reporting plasma concentration data or modeling published for this administering route; parameters estimated from general literature on exogenous hyaluronic acid pharmacokinetics.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
