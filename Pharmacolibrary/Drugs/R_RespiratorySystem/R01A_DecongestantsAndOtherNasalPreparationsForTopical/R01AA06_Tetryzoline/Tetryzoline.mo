    </table><p>Tetryzoline (also known as tetrahydrozoline) is an imidazoline derivative used as a topical decongestant for relieving redness in the eyes and nasal congestion. It acts as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, causing vasoconstriction. Tetryzoline is available in over-the-counter ocular (eye drops) and nasal preparations in many countries but systemic/injectable use is not approved.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetics for healthy adult population based on published data for topical imidazoline decongestants and tetrahydrozoline class due to lack of primary PK studies on tetryzoline.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
