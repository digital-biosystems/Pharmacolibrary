    </table><p>Mepyramine (also known as pyrilamine) is a first-generation antihistamine used primarily as an antiallergic and antipruritic agent. It acts as an H1-receptor antagonist and was originally used for allergies, hay fever, and the common cold. Use has significantly declined due to sedative effects, and it is not widely used as a systemic antihistamine today but may be found in some topical preparations or combination over-the-counter medicines.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are estimated for an average healthy adult; published clinical PK data for mepyramine are extremely limited.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
