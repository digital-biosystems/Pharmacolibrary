While such combinations were formerly more common, their use today is limited and may not be approved or recommended in many countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published peer-reviewed pharmacokinetic data could be found for the combination product in recognized literature. Parameters below are estimated based on known PK properties of choline theophyllinate alone in adults, oral administration; adrenergic PK not separated.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
