    </table><p>Opium derivatives and expectorants (ATC code R05FA02) are combination drugs used primarily in the past for the symptomatic treatment of cough. The opium derivative is typically codeine or morphine or similar alkaloids, combined with expectorants such as guaifenesin to aid in the clearance of respiratory mucus. Most combination products in this category have been largely discontinued or are no longer recommended due to risks of opioid use and the availability of safer alternatives.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for an adult population based on known data for codeine/guaifenesin combinations, as no direct PK studies for the specific ATC combination could be identified.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
