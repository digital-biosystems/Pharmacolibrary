    </table><p>Oxeladin is a centrally acting, non-opioid cough suppressant previously used for the symptomatic treatment of non-productive cough. It is a cough medicine that was historically marketed in several countries but is currently not widely approved or used, in part due to limited evidence and the availability of newer alternatives.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No peer-reviewed pharmacokinetic data (such as bioavailability, clearance, volume of distribution, or compartmental modeling) are available for oxeladin in the published literature as of 2024.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
