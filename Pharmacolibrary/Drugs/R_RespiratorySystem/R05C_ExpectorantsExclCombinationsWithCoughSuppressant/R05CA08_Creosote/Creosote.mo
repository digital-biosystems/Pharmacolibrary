    </table><p>Creosote is a complex mixture of phenolic compounds derived from the distillation of tar, primarily used historically as a disinfectant, expectorant, and externally as an antiseptic. It was formerly indicated for cough and respiratory tract diseases but is no longer approved as a therapeutic drug due to its toxicity and carcinogenic potential.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published human pharmacokinetic studies or clinical PK models specifically for creosote are available. Estimated parameters provided below refer to a hypothetical adult oral administration in the absence of referenced data.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
