    </table><p>Iodine iolopride (123I) is a radiopharmaceutical agent used in nuclear medicine, primarily for imaging dopamine D2 receptors in the brain via single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). It is not generally used as a therapeutic drug, but as a diagnostic tool. Its use has been largely limited to research settings or specialized clinical diagnostics, and alternative tracers may be more widely used today.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic parameters available in the literature specific to iodine iolopride (123I) in humans.
