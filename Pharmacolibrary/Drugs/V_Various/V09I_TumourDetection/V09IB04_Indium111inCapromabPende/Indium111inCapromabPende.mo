    </table><p>Indium (111In) capromab pendetide is a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody used as a diagnostic imaging agent for prostate cancer. The antibody targets prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) present in prostate tissue, and the radioactive indium-111 label allows for visualization using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). It was commonly used under the brand name ProstaScint, but is now largely discontinued and not commonly used in current clinical practice.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are not well-documented in published literature. Typical imaging doses were administered intravenously for adult male patients with suspected or confirmed prostate cancer.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
