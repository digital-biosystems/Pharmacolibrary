    </table><p>Fluoroethyl-L-tyrosine (18F), commonly referred to as [18F]FET, is a radiolabeled amino acid analog used primarily as a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for oncological imaging, particularly for the detection and delineation of brain tumors such as gliomas. It is not a therapeutic drug but a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical. [18F]FET is not used as a treatment and does not have traditional pharmacodynamics; its utility is in differentiating tumor tissue from healthy or necrotic tissue by exploiting increased amino acid transport in neoplastic cells.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic data refers to healthy volunteers and glioma patients undergoing [18F]FET PET imaging; typical PK values are drawn from kinetic modeling studies of brain and plasma distribution.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
