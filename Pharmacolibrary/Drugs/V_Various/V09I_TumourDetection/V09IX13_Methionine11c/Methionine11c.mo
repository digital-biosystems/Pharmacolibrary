    </table><p>Methionine (11C) is a radiolabeled form of the essential amino acid methionine, used as a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer in oncology to image protein synthesis in tumors, particularly gliomas and other brain tumors. It is not a therapeutic drug, but a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical and is not approved for therapeutic use.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic estimates are based on published PET imaging literature and radiopharmaceutical handling in adult humans without significant comorbidities; direct compartmental PK values are generally not published, so values are estimated by analogy to similar tracers and compartmental modeling in PET research.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
