    </table><p>Sodium iodide (124I) is a radioactive iodine isotope used as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, primarily to evaluate thyroid gland function, residual thyroid tissue, and metastases in thyroid carcinoma. It is not used therapeutically and serves as a tracer. Despite its diagnostic utility, 124I has not received widespread regulatory approval as standard of care due to its relatively limited availability and high cost compared to other iodine isotopes.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are reported in adult patients (both sexes) undergoing PET imaging for differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Parameters typically relate to healthy adults or patients post-thyroidectomy without severe renal or hepatic impairment.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
