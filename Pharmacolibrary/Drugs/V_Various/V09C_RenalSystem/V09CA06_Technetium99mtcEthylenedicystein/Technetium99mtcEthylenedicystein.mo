It is mainly used for imaging the kidneys to measure renal perfusion and function. This agent is approved in several countries and is used routinely in nuclear medicine.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are estimated based on available literature for adults with normal renal function undergoing routine dynamic renal scintigraphy. No detailed compartmental PK study with quantifiable human PK parameters has been published.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
