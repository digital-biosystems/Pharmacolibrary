    </table><p>Phenolsulfonphthalein (also known as phenol red) is a pH indicator that was historically used as a diagnostic agent for the evaluation of renal function through a urine excretion test. It is not used as a therapeutic drug and is largely obsolete in clinical medicine due to the availability of superior renal function tests. It is not currently approved for diagnostic use in most countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated typical pharmacokinetic parameters for healthy adults based on historical usage for renal function testing; no modern referenced clinical PK studies in humans are available.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
