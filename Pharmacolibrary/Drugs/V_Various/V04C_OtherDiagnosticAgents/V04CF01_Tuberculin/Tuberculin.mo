    </table><p>Tuberculin is a diagnostic antigen derived from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, primarily used in the tuberculin skin test (Mantoux test) to detect latent or active tuberculosis infection. It is not a therapeutic agent. Tuberculin is not approved as a drug for treatment but remains widely used globally for tuberculosis screening.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic models or parameters are available for tuberculin in humans. Tuberculin is not used as a therapeutic drug but as a diagnostic antigen administered intradermally in very low doses, where pharmacokinetic measurement is typically not evaluated or reported.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
