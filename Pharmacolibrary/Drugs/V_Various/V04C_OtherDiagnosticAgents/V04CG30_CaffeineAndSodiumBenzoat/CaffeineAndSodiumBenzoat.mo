    </table><p>Caffeine and sodium benzoate is a combination drug that was historically used as a central nervous system stimulant and respiratory stimulant, particularly in cases of drug-induced depression or respiratory depression. This combination is no longer widely used and has largely been replaced by safer alternatives. Caffeine is a methylxanthine that acts as a stimulant, while sodium benzoate serves as a preservative and increases the solubility of caffeine for injection.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for the IV administration of caffeine and sodium benzoate in healthy adults, based on known pharmacokinetic data for intravenous caffeine.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
