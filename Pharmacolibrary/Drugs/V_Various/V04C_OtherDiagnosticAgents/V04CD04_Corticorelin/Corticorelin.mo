    </table><p>Corticorelin, also known as ovine corticotropin-releasing hormone (oCRH), is a synthetic peptide analog of the naturally occurring hypothalamic peptide corticotropin-releasing hormone. It is mainly used as a diagnostic agent to differentiate between pituitary (Cushing's disease) and ectopic sources of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the evaluation of Cushing's syndrome. Corticorelin is approved for human use as a diagnostic aid, not for therapeutic purposes.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Estimated pharmacokinetics in healthy adults, as no published population PK study is available. Most dosing is by single intravenous administration for diagnostic purposes.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
