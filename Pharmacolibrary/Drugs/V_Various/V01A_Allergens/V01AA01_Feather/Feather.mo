    </table><p>Feather (ATC V01AA01) is classified as an allergen for immunotherapy, specifically used in desensitizing therapy for allergic conditions caused by feather allergens. It is not a therapeutic drug in the conventional sense and its medical use today is extremely rare or obsolete with modern allergy treatments.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic studies exist for feather allergen extracts as they are not typical pharmacological agents; PK parameters are estimated based on general principles of protein allergen extracts used in immunotherapy.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
