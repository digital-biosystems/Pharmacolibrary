    </table><p>A combination of the amino acids L-arginine and L-lysine, primarily used to enhance renal uptake of radiolabelled somatostatin analogues during peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) for neuroendocrine tumors. Administered as an adjunct to reduce radiation-induced nephrotoxicity. Approved as a supportive medical product for this application.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published pharmacokinetic models reporting compartmental parameters for the combined arginine and lysine formulation in the clinical context of kidney protection during PRRT in adults; typical parameters are not reported in primary literature.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
