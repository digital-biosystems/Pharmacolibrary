    </table><p>4-dimethylaminophenol (DMAP) is an aromatic amine used as an antidote to cyanide poisoning, primarily by inducing methemoglobinemia, which binds cyanide ions to form the non-toxic cyanomethemoglobin. It is not generally approved for clinical use in most countries today and is mainly used in emergency or experimental settings, particularly in some European countries.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters have not been reported in peer-reviewed clinical or preclinical studies in humans. All values below are estimates based on related properties of aromatic amines and known clinical usage.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
