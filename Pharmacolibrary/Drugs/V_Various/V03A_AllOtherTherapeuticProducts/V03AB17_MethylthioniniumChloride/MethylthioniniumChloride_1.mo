    </table><p>Methylthioninium chloride, also known as methylene blue, is a thiazine dye that has been used medically for methemoglobinemia, ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy, cyanide poisoning, and as a surgical dye. It is also being explored for use in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. The drug is approved for use in several countries for specific indications, primarily methemoglobinemia.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters in healthy adults after single oral administration.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
