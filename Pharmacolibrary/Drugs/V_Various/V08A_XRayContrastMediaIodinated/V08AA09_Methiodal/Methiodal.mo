    </table><p>Methiodal is an iodinated contrast agent that was formerly used for radiographic imaging procedures, particularly urography and myelography. It is a water-soluble derivative of iodinated aromatic compounds. Due to the development of safer and less toxic contrast agents, methiodal is no longer in clinical use and is considered obsolete.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published original pharmacokinetic studies with detailed parameters for methiodal in humans have been identified. The following are estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for a typical adult, based on general properties of older iodinated contrast agents and analogous substances.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
