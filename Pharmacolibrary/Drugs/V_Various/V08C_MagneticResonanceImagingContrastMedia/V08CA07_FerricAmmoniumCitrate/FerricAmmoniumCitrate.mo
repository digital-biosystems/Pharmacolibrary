    </table><p>Ferric ammonium citrate is an iron(III) salt of citric acid used as a source of iron in food supplements and occasionally as a contrast agent in medical imaging. Historically, it has been used to treat iron-deficiency anemia but is now rarely used for this indication due to the availability of better-tolerated iron preparations. Ferric ammonium citrate is not a first-line iron supplement in contemporary clinical practice.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>No published human pharmacokinetic (PK) studies specific to ferric ammonium citrate as a drug for systemic absorption were identified. Parameters are estimated based on typical oral iron salt PK characteristics reported in the literature.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
