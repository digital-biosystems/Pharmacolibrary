    </table><p>Yttrium (90Y) citrate colloid is a radioactive compound used mainly as a radiopharmaceutical for radiosynovectomy - the treatment of chronic synovitis such as in rheumatoid arthritis by intra-articular injection. It is not a routinely used drug today due to newer agents and procedural advances, but may be used in specific settings for palliative therapy of joint pain.</p><h4>Pharmacokinetics</h4><p>There are currently no published pharmacokinetic models with reported parameters for yttrium (90Y) citrate colloid in humans. Estimates below are based on general properties of radio-colloids and parenteral radiopharmaceuticals.</p><h4>References</h4><ol></ol></body></html>",
